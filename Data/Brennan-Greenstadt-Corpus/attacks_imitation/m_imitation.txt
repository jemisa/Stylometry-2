Floating in the blue sky are puffy white clouds.  Far below him he can see the ground.  A patchwork quilt of greens and browns.  Roads bisecting fields.  Crops in all directions each adding a splash of unique color to the landscape stretched as far as his eyes can see.  And him weightless suspended above it all.  One with the clouds and the sky.  Suddenly he begins plummeting towards the ground.  Falling becomes his reality.  He hurtles faster and faster.  He enters the top of a cloud to feel a cool mist on his face.  Seconds feel like minutes as his life flashes before his eyes.  He knows that his heart is beating faster and harder than ever before and threatening to leap from his chest.  He emerges from the bottom of the cloud.  The ground rushes towards him gaining more intensity and definition each second.  Now he can see individual buildings.  Cars.  People.  Directly below him a power line.  Closer every second.  Only about a hundred feet away.  Now fifty.  Ten.          He wakes with a start.  Cold sweat drips from his chest and arms.  Like a stream in rivulets down his body.  Each gasping breath filling his lungs with fire.  He looks frantically around the room to convince himself that he is safe.  Everything was exactly the way that he left it the night before.  Right down to the pile of laundry in front of his dresser.  He never could be bothered to use a laundry basket.  He looks to the clock on the cable box and realizes that he has overslept.  It is a curse that he has never managed to dispel.  Following him his entire life.          He pulls the sheets from his sweaty body and the cool air makes him shiver.  Wrapping a towel around himself he walks to the door and steps out into the hallway.  To his right is a drafty door that he has never quite managed to block up.  He hurries up the spiral staircase to his left up towards his kitchen and bathroom.  Shutting the bathroom door behind him he wrestles with the broken lock.  Now frustrated he gives up and turns to the shower. Pulling the handle out.  Watching the water arc through the air and sparkle before his eyes until it crashes onto the cold fiberglass below.          He drops his towel and pulls the curtain aside.  He steps into the stream and smiles as the hot water pelts his body.  The water dances on his scalp then turns to run down his body.  He sighs and stretches as the water washes away the last of the sweat that had been drying on his body.  After quickly lathering and rinsing off he steps out of the shower and grabs his towel and navigates his way back to his bedroom.  The drafty door causes him a sudden chill as he ducks back into the security of his own room.  As he dresses for class and prepares to leave his thoughts return to the dream he had the night before.  Walking out the door he resolves to try skydiving as soon as he possibly can.
