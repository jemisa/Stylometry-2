If there were only one apartment building in Hell, it would be mine. My neighborhood is filled with drunk college students.  Every night, all night long, all I can here is music and screaming.  Over the cacophony of rioting collegiates, I can hear sirens wailing throughout the night, either cops coming to arrest the thugs that stalk my neighborhood or ambulances coming to pump the alcohol out of those who drank more than they could stomach.  All I can do is crawl into my bed and yearn for the sweet embrace of death.          When I wake up in the morning to the screeching sound in the boiler room, the first thing to hit my eyes is the sunlight seeping in from the dank alleyway next to my apartment.  I get up and walk up the spiral staircase connecting my basement apartment to the rest of the world, and decide to make myself some breakfast.  Stepping around the piles of junk laying scattered around the apartment for lack of any storage space to put them in, I walk up to the sagging cabinets to pull out a bowl and a box of cereal.  I open the drawer with the silverware only to have it dump its entire contents on the floor... again.  After cleaning up the mess, I walk to the refrigerator to grab some milk, stepping into the puddle that seems to always form under it. Sighing, I pour the milk, and enjoy my cornflakes, getting ready for another day at school.          After getting dressed, I walk out of my apartment, locking the door behind me, and out into the dreary day.  Looking in any direction, all I can see are trash-filled streets and junk cars.  I sigh.  The houses and storefronts are all drab, with peeling paint and collapsing porches.  Every time I look at the row of parked cars it serves only to remind me of the number of tickets I have gotten parking on that street.  There is nothing that I hate more than the Philadelphia Parking Authority.  Somehow, no matter where I park, they always seem to find an excuse to write me a parking ticket.  Not that there is a reasonable amount of parking in this part of the city, but somehow, even after my best efforts to find legal parking, I always get a ticket.  I cannot help but assume that the city has stepped up its ticketing to help offset the effects of the global financial crisis.          After another long sigh, and a quick check to make sure that they have not found anything to ticket me for overnight, I resolve to finally call maintenance to have them fix the persistent leak in my apartment.  I have gotten really sick of the water dripping down my walls every time my neighbor takes a shower.  Then, hefting my backpack on to my shoulders, I set off towards campus for another long day of classes.
